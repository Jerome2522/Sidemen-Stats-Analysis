# Docker Commands Guide - Sidemen ETL Project

This guide contains all the Docker commands we used to set up and run the Sidemen YouTube ETL pipeline.

## üê≥ Basic Docker Commands

### **Check Running Containers**
```bash
docker ps
```
**What it does:** Shows all currently running containers with their status, ports, and names.

```bash
docker ps -a
```
**What it does:** Shows all containers (running and stopped) with their full status.

### **Check Container Resources**
```bash
docker stats
```
**What it does:** Shows real-time resource usage (CPU, memory, network) of running containers.

### **Check Container Resources (One-time)**
```bash
docker stats --no-stream
```
**What it does:** Shows resource usage once and exits (doesn't keep updating).

## üöÄ Docker Compose Commands

### **Start All Services**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
**What it does:** 
- Starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yaml`

### **Stop All Services**
```bash
docker-compose down
```
**What it does:** Stops and removes all containers, but keeps volumes (data).

### **Stop and Remove Everything**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
**What it does:** Stops containers AND removes volumes (deletes all data).

### **Restart All Services**
```bash
docker-compose restart
```
**What it does:** Restarts all running containers without recreating them.

### **Restart Specific Service**
```bash
docker-compose restart airflow-webserver
```
**What it does:** Restarts only the Airflow webserver container.

### **Check Service Status**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
**What it does:** Shows status of all services defined in docker-compose.yaml.

```bash
docker start sidemenproject-airflow-webserver-1
```
**What it does:** Starts a previously stopped container.

### **Remove a Container**
```bash
docker rm sidemenproject-airflow-webserver-1
```

### **Stop All Running Containers**
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```
**What it does:** Stops all currently running containers.

## üîç Logs and Debugging

### **View Service Logs**
```bash

**What it does:** Shows logs from the Airflow webserver service.

### **View Recent Logs**
```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=50 airflow-webserver
```
**What it does:** Shows only the last 50 lines of logs.

### **View All Service Logs**
```bash
docker-compose logs
```
**What it does:** Shows logs from all services.

### **Follow Logs in Real-time**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f airflow-webserver
```
**What it does:** Shows logs and continues to show new logs as they appear.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Commands

### **Connect to MongoDB**
```bash
docker exec -it sidemenproject-mongo-1 mongosh
```
**What it does:** Opens MongoDB shell inside the MongoDB container.

### **Run MongoDB Command**
```bash
docker exec -it sidemenproject-mongo-1 mongosh --eval "use Sidemen; db.sidemen_stats.countDocuments()"
```
**What it does:** Runs a MongoDB command and shows the result.

### **Check MongoDB Health**
```bash
docker exec -it sidemenproject-mongo-1 mongosh --eval "db.runCommand('ping')"
```
**What it does:** Tests if MongoDB is responding properly.

## üîß Airflow Commands

### **Initialize Airflow Database**
```bash
docker-compose run --rm airflow-webserver airflow db init
```
**What it does:** Creates and initializes the Airflow metadata database.

### **Create Airflow User**
```bash
docker-compose run --rm airflow-webserver airflow users create --role Admin --username admin --email admin@example.com --firstname admin --lastname admin --password admin

## üìù Common Workflows

### **Complete Reset (When things go wrong)**
```bash
# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Remove all unused resources
docker system prune -f

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Check if Everything is Working**
```bash
# Check all containers are running
docker ps

# Check Airflow is accessible
curl http://localhost:8081

# Check MongoDB is working
docker exec -it sidemenproject-mongo-1 mongosh --eval "db.runCommand('ping')"
```

### **Daily Operations**
```bash
# Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker ps

# View logs if needed
docker-compose logs airflow-webserver

# Stop when done
docker-compose down
```
